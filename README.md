When I wanted to update my BASH prompt I found a lot of pre-built configuration files with no documentation. I aim to fix that. This will provide MY .bashrc file as well as an explanation of what everything does. There will be youtube videos as well.
Where I will be demonstrating the syntax and explaing what I'm doing, and how it effects the prompt. I'm using Ubunut on WSL, but will also be using BASH in Linux Mint at times. You will see videos from BOTH systems utilizing the same techniques.
